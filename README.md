# mern-location-sharing

This is an app developed by me, in order to utilize knowledge I got from courses I took lately.
(https://github.com/Yevhwnii/nodejs-restapi-course and https://github.com/Yevhwnii/BurgerCreator)

This is MERN stack applicaiton for sharing location where you have been. It is quite simple but served me as a playground for achieved skills.

Instructions:
To run it locally, clone it, go backend folder, run npm install and then npm start. Open a new terminal go to frontend folder and run the same commands.
